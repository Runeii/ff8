# WIP: FF8 GL

The aim is not to implement the full game, but a simulation of the world by parsing the real game files.




## Todo:
* Improve gateways (points where character transitions between maps)
* Add character model
* Implement OPCodes parsing (map and NPC behaviour, ie: populates maps, fixes broken animations, doors)
* Add World Map (an image with finger to warp, not the real full world map)
