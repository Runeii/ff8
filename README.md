# WIP: FF8 GL

The aim is not to implement the full game, but a simulation of the world by parsing the real game files.



Opcode progress:

## Todo:
* Parse NPC chara.one files
* Finish implementation of remaining opcodes
* Add animated rotations/look to NPC characters
* Player character "conga line"
* Improved depth (currently only works for PC, NPCs can clip layers)
